1. if you had to add HP regenerating for unit every 1 second, how would you implement it?
2. if you had to implement player joining the game, and it causing his/her unit spawning on a map at some location, how would you implement it?
3. if you had to implement player pressing enter key to send chat, how would you implement it?
4. how would you implement construction of a snapshot (that contains all entities position data) that gets broadcasted to all clients 20 times a second?


3 - I will create a room socket and on each player click the data will be brodacted to all other player(the data will be send using the server not client)
4 - I will create a function logic that will get all postion data from the serverNetworkEvent (socket listener) (the data will be comming from player input)

                        => snapshot = [] on each tick loop send binary array position to the client
